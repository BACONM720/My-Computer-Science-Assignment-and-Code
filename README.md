<h1>College Assignments</h1>

<h2>First Year</h2>

<h3> C BASIC </h3>
<p>Through out my first year in computer science and information technology course in NUIG, the primary lagnuage was C basic. C basic is a great initial language due to its more low-level nature in comparison to Python or Java, it provides a great foundational knowledge of programming as well as showcasing memory management.</p>
<p>Every week we had a 2 hour lab where we would be given a coding problem akin to that of what you would find on sites like leet code. eg. sum up the first n numbers or revers this string. These problems while easy in retrospect, cultivated a problem solving attitude and improved my technical programing abilities. </p>
