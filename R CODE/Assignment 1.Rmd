I have created some data and have caculated some numerical and graphical summaries.

Theses are the data:

```{r create data and calculate mean}

data1 <- c(10, 23,14,12,34,26,28,24,15)

```
```{r}
mean(data1)
```
the summary statistics (min, max, Q1, median, and Q3) are:
```{r}
summary(data1, )
```
A boxplot would look like
 
```{r}
boxplot(data1)
```
and a histogram ....

```{r}
hist(data1)
```
